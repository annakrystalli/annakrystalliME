Anna is a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at the University of Sheffield with a background in Marine Macroecology and research software development in R. She is part of a team of RSEs working to help researchers build more robust analysis pipelines and software, promote best practice in research programming and digital resource management and facilitate the shift to more open, transparent and collaborative research culture.  

She is also an editor for rOpenSci, a 2019 Software Sustainability Institute Fellow and a co-organiser of the Sheffield R Users group. Overall, her passion lies in helping researchers and the research community as a whole make better use of the real workhorses of research, code and data, and in spreading the word about the joys of R.
