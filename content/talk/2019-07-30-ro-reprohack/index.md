Talk for the rOpenSci Community Call on Reproducible Research with R, which included Ben Marwick introducing research compendia and Karthik Ram on holepunch, an R package that will to help "binderise" your GitHub repo.  

I spoke about the ReproHack series of one day reproducibility hackathons where participants try to reproduce papers from published code and data. Find out more about what goes on during the events, some early findings, future directions and how you can get involved!
