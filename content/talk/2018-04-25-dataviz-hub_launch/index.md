Talk at the first Data Visualisation Hub ([dataviz.shef](http://dataviz.shef.ac.uk/)) Forum event, an intitative which aims to spark cross-disciplinary collaborative relationships, knowledge exchange and capacity building around data visualisation at the University of Sheffield. I discussed our hopes and plans for the Hub.
